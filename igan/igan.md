# IgA Nephropathy

[IgAN review by James V. Donadio, etc](https://pedclerk.uchicago.edu/sites/pedclerk.uchicago.edu/files/uploads/NEJMra020109.pdf)

Primary IgA nephropathy is cahraterized by a highly variable course ranging from a totally benign condition to rapidly progressive renal failure. From 15 to 40 percent of patients will eventually have end stage renal disease. CHronic, sloly progressive renal failure develops in most of these patients.

In both children and adults, hypertension, high glomerular histopathological scores, persistent microscopic hematuria and proteinuria of more than 1 g per 24 hours, and impaired renal function at the time of diagnosis stand out as consistent and strong predictors of poor renal survival.

Fewer than 10% of all parients with IgAN have complete resolution of urinary abnormalities. IgAN has the potential for slowly progressive chronic renal impairment, leading eventually to end-stage renal disease. Approximately 25 to 30% of any published cohort will require renal replacement therapy within 20 to 25 years of presentation. From first symptoms, 1.5% of patients with IgAN have been calculated to reash ESRD per year.

The clinical course of IgA nephropathy is variable. Estimates of renal survival are often biased because many patients have stage 3 or 4 chronic kidney disease at biopsy or the data are censored for death before patients erach the primary outcome measure of ESRD or precent decrease in the estimated glomerular filtration rate.

The likelihood of dialysis or death was recently estimated with the use of three risk factors that are documented at biopsy: urinary protein excretion of more than 1 g per day, hypertension (>140/90 mm Hg), and severe hitologic lesions on the basis of glomerular, vascular, tubular, and interstitial features. The 20-year predicted survival without of the need of dialysis was 96% among patients with no risk factors versus 36% among those with three factors. THe 10-year renal survival rate is about 90% among adults and children with normal renal function at diagnosis.

Some patients have a prolonged clinical remission (normal serum creatinine concentration, normal findings on urinalysis, normal quantitative urinary protein excretion, and normal blood preasure), but repeat biopsy usually shows glomerular IgA. Most patients with acute kidney injury associated with macroscopic hematuria whave spontaneous recover of renal function within several weeks. In the small subgroup of patients with histologic features of minimal change disease, proteinuria resolves after glucocorticoid therapy.

Univariate analysis indicated that patients who were male, had hypertension, proteinuria of more than 1 g/day, renal impairment (estimated glomerular filtration rate < 60mL/min.1.73m^2), and a high histological grading were associated with poor prognosis.

[Long-Term Outcomes of IgAN Presenting with Minimal or No Proteinuria](https://jasn.asnjournals.org/content/23/10/1753?ijkey=927c74ba4ade53cc28303714ac4005be62647bcc&keytype2=tf_ipsecsha)

Here we studied 141 Caucasian patients with biopsy-proven IgA nephropathy who had minor abnormalities at presentation and a median follow-up of 108 months. None of the patients received corticosteroids or immunosuppressants. We reviewed renal biosies using the Oxford classfication criteria. In this sample, 46 (32%) patients had
mesangial proliferation, whereas endocapillary proliferation, focal glomerulosclerosis, and tubulointerstitial
abnormalities were uncommon. Serum creatinine increases .50% and .100% were observed in five (3.5%)
patients and one (0.7%) patient, respectively; no patients developed ESRD. After 10, 15, and 20 years, 96.7%,
91.9%, and 91.9% of patients maintained serum creatinine values less than a 50% increase, respectively.
Using Cox proportional hazards regression, the presence of segmental glomerulosclerosis was the only
factor that significantly associated with a .50% increase in serum creatinine. Clinical remission occurred
in 53 (37.5%) patients after a median of 48 months. Proteinuria.0.5 and .1.0 g/24 h developed in 21
(14.9%) and 6 (4.2%) patients, respectively. Median proteinuria at the end of follow-up was 0.1 g/24 h,
with 41 (29.1%) patients having no proteinuria. At presentation, 23 (16.3%) patients were hypertensive
compared with 30 (21.3%) patients at the end of follow-up; 59 (41.8%) patients were treated with reninangiotensin blockers because of hypertension or increasing proteinuria. In summary, the long-term prognosis for Caucasian patients with IgA nephropathy who present with minor urinary abnormalities and
normal renal function is excellent.
