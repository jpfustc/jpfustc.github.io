# How to be a programmer by Robert L. Read

A lot of topic. I'll simply take notes on things of interest.

## On debugging

* print lining? debugging tool? logging
* poke at the code to make it jump

## On Schedule Estimation

* Be explicit
* Pad explicitly. If documentation takes time, note it, instead of simply extend your development duration. This helps maintain trust, and also helps improving your estimation over time
* Upon un-evaluable risks, state so forcefully enough that your supervisor does not commit to them and later get embarassed

## How to utilize people as source of information

* Just the right amount of communication. Learn about them, help them learn about you, but respect both sides' time
* Don't hesitate to ask when you truely believe they have something valuable to say

## How to learn new skills

* 'A goot mentor is no replacement of doing thins yourself, but is a lot better than a book. What can you offer a potential mentor in exchange for their knowledge? At a minimum, you should offer to study hard so their time won't be wasted'. Even a potential mentor

## How to manage development

* The project plan exists to help pass information and make decisions, not to show how organized you are.
* Don't hold the bad news if you miss a milestone. The deliver time has already slipped, you may catch up in the later part but you may slip some more.

## How to communicate the right amount

* If you are having a meeting and anyone is bored, that should be a sign that perhaps you should have smaller meetings

## How to disagree honestly and get away with it

* If you  can support this decision despite disagreement, say so.
* Evaluate if you should raise the issue on the basis of the benefit to the tribe.
* Probably no one will ever have a right to say 'I told you so' since the alternative will not have been fully explored

## How to grow porfessionally

* Assume responsibility in excess of your authority
* Instigate the formation of consensus. Take responsibility of the schedule.
