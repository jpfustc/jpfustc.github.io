# Design Patterns for Algorithm Engineers

This blog may serve as a hands on guidance for a radar algorithm engineer on how to practice design patterns by GOF.

## Introduction: What and Why

Design patterns, as its subtitle points out, is a book about writing **reusable** software with **object oriented** programming paradagim. It allows you to be prepared for predictable but yet to come changes in your software: by separating what is likely to change from what is likely stable.

A quote I like a lot form Robert Reads on this issue: 'The advanced programmer must do more. You must design a grow path that ends in the finished system'. A research guy like a radar algorithm engineer may seldom know what the finished system is, but it doesn't prevent him from preparing for growth of his software.

A radar algorithm engineer most often codes for numerital simulations, this means that you may spent more time on meaningful experiments rather than tediously copy-pate your code everywhere. More importantly, it allows you to efficiently manage greater variaties of algorithm combinations, instead of simulate one procedure with others left over idealized.
