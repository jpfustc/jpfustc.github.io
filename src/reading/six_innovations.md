# How we got to now: six innovations ...

一本以器物为纲的科普散文. 几个关键词包括"hummingbird effect": 一些因素如何以跨越性的方式推动了另一些进步; "long zoom": 穿过不同的学科范畴寻找某种模糊的跨越式的关联; "robot historian": 暂时离开以人为中心的叙事视角, 阐述物质/技术在历史上发挥的作用.

应该说作者对于这些新鲜视角的阐述, 其实并不具备多大程度的客观性. 例如谈镜子对近代欧洲资产阶级启蒙中"个人中心视角"的启发作用, 谈"制冷"作为一种商品, 突破了"高能量密度意味着高价值"的盲区, s但随后的论述局限于对少数文献的引用, 或者一小段翻来覆去的车轱辘话. 这些思绪的知识价值远逊于它的审美价值. 在真正的科技细节上着墨不多: 例如第一章中将玻璃的透明归功于硅元素电子能级差距大, 不能吸收可见光, 却没有进一步讲为何硅的氧化物仍能保持这种性质, 或者碱盐如何改善玻璃的透明度; 由玻璃而讲到玻璃纤维, 光纤, 以及各种光学组件时, 也对一切工艺细节避而不谈. 故而说, 这是一本科普散文, 它所提供的技术知识并不比少儿百科全书多.

书中有些有趣的引用, 可以考虑作为以后的阅读材料:

* "complexity theorist" Stuart Kauffmann
* Nelson W. Polsby: How Congress Evolves
* Upton Sinclair: 他的主要作品是小说, 如果有社论一类的内容读起来更快效率更高.
* Jacob Riis: How the Other Half Lives, 20世纪初期, 描述美国以移民为主的贫困工人阶级的生活情况

这本书带给我的一大乐趣来自它奇差的翻译质量. 我在第一章中找到了大概二十五个翻译错误. 抛开语法和"长难句"不谈, 同一个人名隔了几页出现两个不同的译名, Fahrenheit译成摄氏度, 以及在原文明确讨论"玻璃"时把"glass"译为镜子, 这些都是职业操守问题. 这大概是出版社找了一位署名译者, 后者找了几个本科生或者高中生, 每千字十块钱翻译出来的玩意儿.

另一大乐趣来自作者扭捏或者说谨慎的"左翼倾向". 

* "there is a material element to our history as well: not the dialectical materialisim that Marxism practiced... Material history, instead, in the sense of history as shaped by the basic building blocks of matter, which are then connected to things like social movements or economic systems"; 事实上"Speech at the Grave of Karl Marx"中恩格斯本来也是这么说的: "the simple fact, ... that mankind must first of all eat, drink, have shelter and clothing, before it can pursue politics, science, art, religion, etc; that therefore the production of the immediate material maens, ... form the foundation of upon which the state institutions, the legal conceptions ... have been evolved, and in the light of which they must, therefore, be explained."
* Upton Sinclair: "the greatest aggregation of labor and capital ever gathered in one place". Sinclair是一位活跃在二十世纪上半叶的作家和左翼社会活动家, 前面的引用是以讽刺的口吻描绘芝加哥的肉制品产业, 出自小说"the Jungle". 作者对此表示, "Progressives like Upton Sinclair painted Chicago as a kind of Dante's Inferno of industrialization, but in reality, most of the technology employed in the stockyards would have been recognizable to a medieval butcher. The most advanced form of technology in the whole chain was the refrigerated railcar."
* "However much we celebrate the start-up culture of today's tech world, essential innovations don't always come out of private-sector exploration. New ideas are not always motivated, like Tudor's, by dreams of 'fortunes larger than we shall know what to do with'. The art of human invention has more than one muse." 作者引出为了救治疟疾病人而发明人工制冷手段的佛州医生John Gorrie时如是说. 而这种高尚的结局是, "Tudor himself launched a smear campaign about Gorrie's invention, claiming the ice produced by his machine was infected with bacteria. John Gorrie died penniless, having failed to sell a single machine."

## 一些记录

* 第二章"coldness": Tudor在首次出发将波士顿采得的冰贩往Martinique岛之前几个月就派自己的弟弟和堂弟前去与当地商人谈专营权. 市场意识, 接触客户, 诚不我欺.

* 第二章先谈了19世纪上半叶, 最早的冰块大亨Tudor如何开拓中南美洲乃至印度的市场; 然后镜头切到1860年, 纽约城三分之二的家庭订冰. 作者并没有专门提及两个市场和商业模式之间的巨大差异: 前者是全球转运的奢侈品, 后者是本地规模产销的消费品; 当然也就更没有触及两种商业模式所分别依赖的的社会基础之间的变革.

* 第三章: 爱迪生设想留声机可以用于一种有声信件, 而贝尔预期电话会被用于放送现场演出.

* 第三章: "How many messages do you suppose go in and out of those buildings every day? Suppose there was no telephone and every message had to be carried by a personal messenger?"

* 第三章对于贝尔实验室卓越贡献的阐述: "It was not just the diversity of talent, and the tolerance of failure, and the willingness to make big bets. What made the Bell Labs fundamentally different had as much to do with antitrust law as the geniuses it attracted. ... in 1956. AT&T would be allowed to maintain its monopoly over phone service, but any patented invention that had originated in Bell Labs would have to be freely licensed to any American company that found it useful, and all new patents would have to be licensed for a modest fee."

* 第六章: "In 2001, the historian Roger Ekirch published a remarkable study that drew upon hundreds of diaries and instrucitonal manuals to convincingly argue that humans had historically divided their long nights into two distinct sleep periods. When darkness fell, they would drift into 'first sleep', waking after four hours to snack, relieve themselves, have sex, or chat by the fire, before heading back for another four hours of 'second sleep'".

## 后记

在B站上看到一个Stuart Kauffman在science and nonduality conference的演讲. [这个机构](https://www.scienceandnonduality.com/)看上去像是一个Hipster repilca一般的现代灵修邪教组织, 整个网站上找不到什么跟science有关的内容. 到处都是主观得不能再主观的无法理解和沟通的内容. 其中一位'board member'写的书名比轻小说还长: "The End of Self-Help: Discovering Peace and Happiness Right at the Heart of Your Messy, Scary, Brilliant Life". 配合这篇[灵性剩女的七种武器](https://mp.weixin.qq.com/s/KNb8-CbUPr-v5K7TQllDsg)食用风味更佳.
