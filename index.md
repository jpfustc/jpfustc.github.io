### About Me
Hi guys. I'm a 26-year old millimeter-wave radar algorithm engineer at [Calterah Semiconductor](www.calterah.com). My job mainly combines digital signal processing, data analysis/feature extraction, as well as application layer programming on a high level. I'm also interested in neat coding as well as project management skills, which is exactly what I lack of.

I'm love board games (e.g. [terra mystica tornament](tmtour.org)), finger style guitar, swimming and improv. Not that I'm good at any of them.

### About This Website
It is currently maintained as a markdown based static repository of my notes on tech/entertaining readings, daily life, etc. Hope you enjoy it.
