# Juliet, Nacked by Nick Horngy      《赤裸的朱丽叶》

## Excerpt 6                选段 6

*  Introduction

Tucker, a self-diagnosed patient of avoidant personality disorder, flew across the Atlantic to comfort his daughter after her miscarriage with reluctance. Hearing the news, his new English pen-pal Annie came to London to meet him, in hope of holding on to the faint connection between them. Soon after his arrival Tucker had a heart attack and missed their appointment, leaving Annie uninformed.

55岁的前音乐人 Tucker 和来自北英格兰小镇 Gooleness 的Annie 是新近相识的笔友，二人间有一点隐约的相惜。Tucker 自认有逃避型人格障碍，如今知悉自己与前妻的女儿流产，不大情愿地飞赴伦敦安慰她。Annie 得知 Tucker 的旅程，前来伦敦见他。Tucker 到达未久便意外心脏病发，留得 Annie 不知情苦等。


(把背景剧情补充完整。这段并不是什么千里送炮...两个中年男女没有干柴烈火，就是一点 faint connection。二人都对彼此产生过一些微妙情愫，但互不知情，甚至自己也不甚肯定。相较之下，Tucker 屡屡搞砸自己的婚姻，对感情早已有些麻木；而Annie刚从一段20年的糟糕关系中觉醒挣脱出来，更珍惜一些。同样，见面这件事虽由 Tucker 提出来，却是 Annie 更积极也更紧张。)

self-diagnosed patient of avoidant personality disorder 这句内容并非原文情节。Tucker 屡经婚姻失败，与一连串子女也都没有感情，也没有弥补的意思，而不断忽略别人需要的同时为自己开脱。这次听闻女儿流产，还是最近一位前妻劝他（命令他）去安慰。因为篇幅关系，直接按自己的理解，裁剪为自认逃避型人格。
faint connection, 原先想到的是spark，但嫌太清楚明白，不够朦胧。
appointment，还考虑了date 和 meet up。都觉得太轻松舒适，没有初次见面的距离和疑虑。


* Excerpt

At first, Annie was glad Tucker and Jackson were late. It gave her time to compose herself, think about the version of herself she wished present. Yes, there was some kind of connection between her and Tucker, maybe, but it was a gossamer cyberthread: blow it and it would break. And yet, if he'd arrived bang on the dot of three, she would probably have been unable to resist running up to him and throwing her arms around his neck, which was presuming a lumpy reciprocal weight of feeling for which she had no evidence whatsoever. By ten past, she had resolved to give him a friendly peck on the cheek, and ten minutes after that she was wondering whetherthe peck shouldn't be downgraded to a handshake, although she'd do that two-handed clasp thing to convey warmth. By quarter to four, she didn't really like him very much anyway.

刚到三点的时候 Annie 觉得 Tucker 和 Jackson  迟到是件好事，这样她有更多时间冷静，斟酌自己用什么方式面对 Tucker 比较合适。她对 Tucker 音乐的评论的确让他有共鸣，可那不过就是篇帖子，太当回事儿只会显得她很傻. Tucker 没理由对她另眼相看，可是她实在有种冲上去拥抱他的冲动。十分钟后 Tucker 还没有出现，她控制住自己了，觉得轻轻亲一下脸颊比较得体；再过十分钟她觉得握手也不错，不过得是双手握才显得足够热切。到了三点四十五，Annie 觉得自己本来也没多么欣赏 Tucker。

* 翻译评论

[注： Jackson 是 Tucker 6岁的小儿子，受他宠爱]

bang on the dot of three, 顺序调整到段首

which was persuming a lumpy reciprocal weight of feeling for which she had no evidence whatsoever 翻译为他没理由对她另眼相看。由于语序调整，后文实在有种冲动强调了一下。

末句 really, very much, anyway，一连串委婉曲折的表述。

And of course, if she'd known there was any chance of outrageous rudeness on this scale, she'd have suggested meeting somewhere other than Dickens house in Doughty Street. There weren't any shops or cafes around, nowhere she could sit inside and watch the entrance to the museum while sipping on a cappuccino that would cost roughly the same as a terraced house back in Gooleness. She just had to stand there in the street, feeling stupid. And though she had known, somewhere inside her, that a feeling of foolishness would be an inevitable and unavoidable consequence of this silly flirtation(could a flirtation be as one-sided as this one, without becoming merely a crush?), she'd rather hoped that it would come later on, when he didn't reply to her emails afterwards. It hadn't occurred to her that he simply wouldn't show up. But what did she expect? He was a reclusive recovering alcoholic former rock star. None of that suggested a person who'd trot up to a museum at three o' clock on the dot on a Thursday afternoon.

倘若她早些意识到到 Tucker 竟会如此无礼地晾着她，她就不选在狄更斯博物馆门口见面了。这条路上没有一家店供她坐下来喝杯贵的要死的咖啡慢慢等，只能傻傻地站在街上。其实她有想过，自己这场头脑发热的撩汉注定不过是犯蠢（像她一样自作多情的撩汉怎么可能不是犯蠢呢），可她没想到一切会这么快结束. 至少等到见过一面再开始不回消息吧，总不能这样招呼都不打就不出现了。不过话说回来，她想什么呢，他是一个玩音乐的人，遁世多年，正努力戒酒，怎么看都不像是会在周四下午三点准时赴约逛博物馆的样子。

* 翻译评论

[注： 在他们邮件往来中，Tucker 曾提到自己在读狄更斯的小说]

这段翻译下来意外地顺，口语化比较严重。

would be an inevitable and unavoidable consequence... 我不明白 inevitable 和 unavoidable 有什么区别，这里要连用。

What to do? After an hour, and after considering and then rejecting a tour of the house on her own(because she suddenly didn't love Dickens as much as she'd made out), she walked towards Russell Square. she'd given him her mobile number, but he'd offered nothing in return, cunningly, she could see now. All she knew was that he was staying in his daughter's flat, but even if she were detective enough to obtainthe relevant details, she wouldn't call, and she certainly wouldn't knock on the door. She had some pride.

现在怎么办？她已经等了一个小时，也纠结了一个小时要不要自己进去看看，最后还是放弃了. 她突然意识到自己对狄更斯的兴趣大部分是装的。她朝拉塞尔广场走去，想起自己把电话报给 Tucker，他却没提他的号码。真是狡猾，她现在看出来了。她只知道 Tucker 在他女儿的公寓里落脚，可就算她有本事能查出什么线索，她也不会再联系他了，更不会上门。她还有些自尊。

Somewhere in her she hadn't given up on him, otherwise she'd have gone back to her cheap and musty hotel room near the British Museum, collected her overnight bag and gone back to Goolenesson the train. She didn't want to, though. When she got to Russell Square, she saw a poster outside an arts cinema advertising a French film and she sat on her own in the dark for a couple of hours, squinting at the subtitles. She set the phone to vibrate, and checked it every few minutes just in case she'd somehow failed to feel the vibrations, but there was no message, no missed call, no evidence that she d ever arranged to meet anyone.

她心里总还有些希望，不然早就回寒酸的旅店，收拾起小包裹回 Gooleness 了。她还不想就这么回去。到了拉塞尔广场，她看到一家小众影院正放一部法国片，就进去在黑暗中坐了几个小时。她把手机调成振动，每隔几分钟就看一眼，免得自己漏掉什么，可是什么都没有，没有短信，没有未接来电，就像没人跟她约好见面一样。

* 翻译评论

翻译得顺到我觉得不对劲...果然是定语从句少就好翻。


* 选段注解

思绪十分散乱，可能让人看不懂。Tucker 没有知会便不出现，Annie 觉得不满本是理所当然的事。可是恋爱中的头脑，并不能照常处理这种不满，而是产生一种特别自大的想当然：对方的行动和表现，一定代表了对我的肯定或否定。Tucker 失信毁约，本该是他的责任，Annie 却硬要解释为是自己的原因，是对她的否定；仿佛把自己锁在了斯金纳箱里，接受正负反馈的训练。一方面要把 Tucker 视作特别的存在，另一方面又要保护自己的尊严，整段内心矛盾，其实都是自己的分裂，大约所有情场失意的人都有过的。

说到底，这是 make everything about oneself 的问题。倘若 Annie 早点拿出别太拿自己当回事的态度，大概不必再如此失态。也许生活太平淡，需要自己制造一点波澜来调剂？这些小心思，旁观起来可叹可怜，然而在亲历者看来正是活着的证据？我突然好奇，动物求偶的时候是否也会伤自尊，或是失败也不妨死缠烂打，纵然没有结果，太阳超常升起。

## Excerpt 4

* Introduction

Former singer-songwriter Tucker has been half-intentionally wasting his life with liquor and broken relationships for two decades. His last marriage with Cat was the most healthy one, seeing that he sobered up and act as a father for their son Jackson. Yet when Cat proposed to end it he made no effort to keep her, as usual. In this section Tucker tried to find out how everything got so wrong.

前摇滚唱作人 Tucker 退隐二十年来终日酗酒，每一位伴侣都终于无法忍受他而离开，他却只逃避。与Cat 相识后他有些起色，戒了酒，并开始承担父亲的责任。然而当 Cat 提出分开时他毫无挽留，一如既往。本段中 Tucker 回顾自己如何一路至此。

准确地说，Tucker 对于一任任伴侣的痛心并非铁石心肠无所感触，但却不愿改变，自觉人不知我，再有一点不肯放手，最后只好拿各种 I don't know, I suppose you're right 来应对对方的质问，passive aggressive。我用中英文都没能阐述这么复杂的意思。我自己是体验过的这种心境的，所以读起来十分明白。虽然我写不出来，幸而小说原文可以。另，特地给忍受加了个宾语，以免误解无法忍受的只是酗酒。

* Excerpt

Tucker now accepted, without question, that he couldn't make a marriage, or anything resembling a marriage, work. (He had never been absolutely sure whether he was married to Cat or not. Cat referred to him as her husband, and it always sounded a little off to him, but he'd never been able to ask her directly whether there was any legal basis for her description of his status. She'd be hurt that hecouldn't remember. Certainly there'd been no ceremony since sobriety, but anything could have happened before that.) He was one of those people whose flaws remained consistent whoever he was with. he'd had friends who d made good second marriages, and they always talked about the relief they'd felt when they realized that the first had gone wrong because of the dynamic, rather than any inherent failing in them. But as several women, women who didn't really resemble each other in any way, had all complained of the same things, he had to accept that dynamics had nothing to dowith anything. It was all him. At the beginning, something-infatuation, hope, whatever-helped disguise his real shape. But then the tide went out, and all was revealed, and it was ugly, dark and jagged and unpleasant.

Tucker 如今信了，他总会把任何一段婚姻，或者跟婚姻差不多的关系搞砸。（他一直搞不清楚他和 Cat 有没有结婚。她把Tucker称作先生，这感觉有点不对劲，但是Tucker总不好开口问。要是 Cat 发现，他连俩人结没结婚都不记得，她得多难过。自戒酒之后他确实不记得办过婚礼；可在那之前他三天两头喝断片儿，那会儿谁知道呢。）他是个死性不改的人，换谁都没用。有些朋友再婚很幸福，如蒙大赦：原来先前的不快都是因为两个人不合拍而已，不是他们自个儿的错。但 Tucker 的每一任伴侣，每个人没有一点相似，却都有同样的不满。他得承认这跟合不合拍没关系，这就是他有问题。每次刚开始的时候，那些女人被热恋，被希望迷住双眼；可当潮水退却，他露出真面目，丑陋，灰暗，崎岖，一无是处。

accepted，without question，原本考虑翻译为认命，不大妥当。认命，仿佛有过抗争，Tucker并没有过抗争，他没有真正重视过任何一位伴侣，懒得挽回。另一方面，认命有用宿命论开脱的嫌疑，而事实上 it was all him. 我觉得这个 accepted 更接近于意识到。

refer to，准确来说，应该是向别人介绍的时候说 Tucker 是她先生。但是翻译成用先生指代 Tucker又太书面。

legal basis，放在后一句有没有结婚

since sobriety，文化差异翻译起来有点难，我是没听说过有人可以酗酒到大段大段失忆的。

whose flaws remained consistent whoever his was with，这句中he was with没有翻译出来，后文勉强解释了一下。

something... disguise his real shape，原文是 something，Tucker 搞不清楚这些人为啥看不清他的真面目，而infatuation，或者hope，只不过是对something的猜测；中文翻译直接取了infatuation，显得很自大。

One of the chief complaints was that he never did anything, which Tucker couldn't help but feel was unfair; not because the complaint was groundless, because it obviously wasn't, but because in certain circles, Tucker was one of the most famous do-nothings in America. All of these women had known that he hadn't done anything since 1986; that, it seemed to him, was his unique selling point, and it was a never-ending source of fascination. But when he'd continued to do nothing, there was outrage. Where was the justice in that? He could see that several of these women, Cat included, had presumed, without ever articulating it or possibly even acknowledging it to themselves, that they'd be able to redeem him, bring him back to life. They'd appointed themselves muses,and he would respond to their love, inspiration and care by makingthe most beautiful and passionate music of his career. And then, when nothing happened, they were left with an ex-musician who sat around the house drinking, watching game shows and reading Victorian novels in his sweatpants, and they didn't like it much. Who could blame them? There wasn't much to like. With Cat it had been different, because he'd sobered up and taken care of Jackson. But he was still a disappointment to her. He was a disappointment to himself, but that didn't help anyone much.

他有一条大罪名是当闲人，什么也不干，这让他不禁觉得委屈；倒不是说这指控是捏造，他确实是个闲人；只是说，他本来就是个出了名的闲人。每一个女人都知道他自1986年以来就一事无成，他觉得她们看上的就是他这一点，多少人为此着迷。可是倘若他坚持做闲人，她们就怒不可遏，这简直不讲道理。有几个人，包括Cat，都以为自己的爱可以救赎 Tucker. 也许她们自己都没有意识到，但他看得出来。她们自认可以带给他灵感，而他会以最美妙热烈的音乐来回馈她们的爱。然而这是一厢情愿，Tucker 依然故我，每天穿着裤衩喝酒看综艺，翻维多利亚小说，这让她们很不爽，也难怪。遇到 Cat 后事情有点不一样，他戒了酒，学着照顾 Jackson，可她还是对他失望。Tucker 也对自己失望，然而没人为此感到安慰。

do nothing 反复出现，总是翻译得比较拧巴。

selling point，没有直译。

articulating 没有翻译出来，直接用了强化讽刺的 acknowledging to themselves. 有点文过其实，不尊重原文

appointed themselves as muses，appoint用的很讽刺，翻译为自认

who could blame them 翻译成难怪，blame 就是怪，怪罪

there's nothing to like，文字游戏，没能翻译出来

disappointment，或许可以翻译成更简单强烈的不爽

help anyone much 有很丰富的意思。

It wasn't as if he was a happy slacker, either. He d never been able to shrug away the loss of his talent, for want of a better word to describe whatever the hell it was he once had. Sure, he'd got used to the idea that there wouldn't be a new album, or even a new song, any time soon, but he'd never learned to look on his inability to write as anything other than a temporary state, which meant that he was permanently unsettled, as if he were in an airport lounge waiting for a plane. In the old days, when he flew a lot, he d never been able to get absorbed in a book until the plane had taken off, so he'd spent the pre-boarding time flicking through magazines and browsing in gift shops, and that's what the last couple of decades had felt like: one long flick through a magazine. If he'd known how long he was going to spend in the airport lounge of his own life he'd have made different travel arrangements, but instead he 'd sat there, sighing and fageting and, more often than was ever real acceptable, snapping at his travelling companions.

他自己也不是乐得一事无成。失去才华--就算是才华吧--那些他曾经拥有的东西这件事他一直未能释怀。没错，他明白自己未来一阵子写不出新专辑，连一首单曲都写不出来。可他一直觉得这枯竭不过是一时放下，自己早晚能重现灵感。怀着这样想法他便总不肯安心，仿佛是在机场候机。曾经他到处飞的时候，每次候机他都看不进书，只好随手翻杂志，在礼品店闲逛。最近二十年他就是这么散漫过来的，翻杂志一样翻过去了。早知道要等这么久他就另作打算了，可他不知道，只是一味烦闷，嗟叹，还有对自己的旅伴发脾气，很过分。

for want of a better word，让步，没有直译

整段用候机的比喻来表现 Tucker 认定自己总归能够恢复创作，因此焦躁地等待，不肯安心好好生活，导致一塌糊涂。翻的不够明显。尤其是make other arrangements，原文很明显可以看出，指的是 Tucker 会放下重新创作的指望，认真生活，但翻译出来，只用了等来呼应，不充分。

more often than ever was acceptable，翻译为过分，取消often，调整语序。

What are you going to do? they asked, all the Cats and Nats and other wives and lovers and mothers of his children whose names sometimes blurred regrettably together. And he always told them what he thought they should want to hear. 'i'm gonna look for a job.' he said, or, "i'm retraining as an accountant. And theyd sign and roll their eyes, which for him merely underlined the impossibility of his situation: how else to answer, other than to say he was going to look for a job, do something else, stop being a former something? A few months back, he'd called Cat on the eye-rolling,asked her for some suggestions. After some deliberation, she announced that she thought he should be a singer-songwriter, but one who actually sang and wrote songs. She hadn't articulated the idea exactly in those terms, of course, but that was pretty much what it amounted to. He'd laughed a lot. she'd gotten angry. One more finger had been prized off the rope they were clinging to.

你有什么打算？她们都问，前妻们，情人们，有时候他连她们的名字都记混，真是对不起。而他就捡他以为她们想听的说。我会找个工作或者我正学会计呢。听了这话她们总是叹气，翻白眼 Tucker觉得自己说什么都是错。他还能说什么呢？除了说自己会找工作，找点事做，不混日子？几个月前，轮到Cat对他的答案翻白眼的时候，他问她有什么建议。她想了想说，他就当唱作人挺好，不过得是正经写歌录音的唱作人。不是她原话，但大概差不多吧。他听了笑得厉害，而她很生气。这在他们无可挽回的关系上又添了一根稻草。

Cats and Nats，谐音梗，与后文搞混名字呼应，没有翻译。[Natalie，aka Nat，是Tucker的另一位前妻，前文女儿Lizzie的母亲]

mothers of his children，春秋笔法，没有翻译。用来与wives and lovers 并列，有些女性同 Tucker 之间既没有结婚也不剩感情，单纯生了个孩子，继续表现 Tucker 的 couldn't make anything resembling a marriage work. 原文四个and 外加谐音，对 Tucker 的荒唐表现得更强烈。

impossibility of his situation，选择直译

former something，妙在something，没有直译

actually，翻译为正经

One more finger... 转译

* 选段评论

Tucker 是这样回忆自己的伴侣们的: 'He could see that several of these women, Cat included, had presumed, without ever articulating it or possibly even acknowledging it to themselves, that they'd be able to redeem him, bring him back to life.'这是一个严重的讽刺。对自己爱过的人使用讽刺是一种亵渎，人不该这样亵渎自己爱过的人；Tucker 不爱她们，至少不记得自己爱过她们。
然而讽刺要成立，一定因为被讽刺的是事实。Cat 们以为自己可以拯救 Tucker，何其自以为是。这并不是 Tucker 的一面之词。'He should be a singer songwriter, but one who actually sang and wrote songs'. 她们只允许他成为自己想要的样子，没有妥协。自大，源自于非分的渴望：她们希望自己的爱能成为艺术，而一个唾手可得的前音乐人，让这渴望变得清晰而动人。她们渴望陪他到明天，可他明天有事，只想过今晚。
Tucker 不满于她们的痴想，自己却纵容痴想。痴想与纵容痴想，既然前者可怜，那一定是后者可恶。倘若 Tucker 能够澄清，便省却她们许多青春与心力。可是他能澄清什么呢？His real shape is disguised. 是她们主动误解他，'without ever articulating it'。未曾表露的误解，何从澄清？未曾表露的痴想，何从点醒？人心微妙，即在于此。Tucker 尽管可以感受到对方的心思，却永远只能疑罪从无；倘若揭露：我知道你是这样想的，那便一样是自以为是了。
因为被误解而被爱，便是这样为难的处境。唯一公平的做法，是一早便推开对方，不让那疑似的误解有生长为痴想的机会。可惜 Tucker 只是一个自私的普通人，他不只渴望理解和认同，也需要性和陪伴。

## Excerpt 3                选段 3

* Instruction

After decades of doing nothing, the former singer-songwriter Tucker was finally bonded with Cat and their son Jackson as a family. He was visited by Lizzie, his daughter with ex-wife, who revealed her pregnacy and came to see what kind of a person her father was. The news made Tucker realize his age and the meaninglessness of his life. In this section Tucker tried to account for the years since he abruptly quit music.

Tucker 曾是一名摇滚唱作人，多年浪荡无所事事后，如今与现任妻子 Cat 和儿子 Jackson 一起生活。Lizzie 是 Tucker 与前妻的女儿，如今将为人母，前来探访 Tucker，希望发现自己的父亲是一个怎样的人。Tucker 恍然意识到自己荒唐一生，年轻不在。本段中，Tucker 试着清点自己放弃音乐以来二十年的生活。

* Excerpt

A while back, Tucker had promised himself that he'd sit down with a piece of paper and try to account for the last couple of decades. He'd write the years down in sequence on the left-hand side, and write down one or two words next to them, words that would at least give some sense of what might have occupied him in those twelve months. The word 'Booze' and a few ditto marks would do for the end of the eighties; occasionally he'd picked up a guitar or a ballpoint, but mostly he d just watched TV and poured Scotch down his throat until he blacked out.

There were other, healthier words he could use later on -"Painting,, Cooper and Jesse, ' Cat, Jackson, but actually, even they didn't explain away as many months as he'd be asking them to. How long had he really spent in that tiny apartment he'd rented and used as a studio, in the painting years? Six months? And his sons, in the years they were born， He'd taken them for walks, sure, but a lot of the time they'd been nursing, or sleeping, and he'd watched them do both. But then, watching was an activity, right? You couldn't do much else, if you were watching.

Occasionally he thought about what his father would have written, if faced with a sheet of paper containing a list of all his adult years. He'd had a long, productive life: three kids, a good, strong marriage, his own dry-cleaning business. So what would he write next to, say, 61-68? Work? That one short word would cover seven years of his life perfectly adequately. And Tucker knew for sure what he'd have chosen for 1980: Europe. Or probably, EUROPE! He'd waited a long time to go back, and he'd loved every second of it, and the holiday of a life time lasted a month. Four weeks, out of thefifty-two! Tucker wasn't trying to flatten out the differences - he knew his dad was the better man. But anyone trying to account for their days in this way was going to wonder where they had all gone, what had been missed out.

前些日子，Tucker 下决心要好好坐下来算帐，看看自己这二十年都干了些什么。他铺开一张纸，左边一列按顺序记下年份，右边则试着填上每一段生活的主题。八几年那会儿基本就是酗酒，酗酒，酗酒，偶尔也会拨几下吉他，写几节谱，但多半都是开着电视灌酒，喝晕为止。

后来生活开始变得健康些，他开始画画，迎来 Cooper 和 Jeese 的出生，再遇见 Cat，学着照顾 Jackson。可即便如此，还是有许多无法解释的空白被荒废了。他在那间租来做画室的小公寓里待了多久？有半年么？然后是这几个小家伙。没错，他是会推着婴儿车带他们出去散步，可大多数时候他们都在母亲怀里喝奶，或者睡觉，而他只需要看着，什么也不做。看着也算是做事吧，对么？毕竟当他看着的时候也没法做别的事。

[Tucker一共与四任妻子生下五位子女，其中Cooper和Jeese是双生子；Jackson是Cat为他诞下的小儿子，也是唯一得到Tucker关爱的孩子。在此之前，他一直在逃避家人。]

Tucker 偶尔会想，他父亲会怎么概括自己的一生。他的生活相当充实：稳固的婚姻，养育三个孩子，还经营自己的干洗店。他能写出什么来呢？比如61-68年，大概就是事业？七年时光，一个词就概括完了。关于80年，他一定会写去欧洲，或者干脆是去欧洲！！。他一直盼着能再去一次，那段时光每一秒都是享受。可这场一生一次的旅行也不过一个月时间，只占80年的十二分之一。Tucker不想否认差距他知道，他父亲要比他强得多。可是倘若以这样严苛的视角审视，任谁都会觉得空虚，奇怪时间都去哪儿了，自己是不是遗漏了什么。

* 选段评论

'You couldn't do much else, if you were watching.'

'But anyone trying to account for their days in this way was going to wonder where they had all gone, what had been missed out.'

颓丧之极的语言被翻译得很零散。上面引用的这种从人物的内心活动跳脱出来，像旁白一样的句子，是 Nick Hornby 常用的写法。尤其是在第一人称写作的《Slam》书中，几乎通篇都是成长后的Sam一边讲述自己的经历，一边作为旁白插科打诨。同时，这些旁白虽然观点鲜明，逻辑清晰，但从遣词到句子的节奏，都充满不坚定感，仿佛沙滩上细碎的海浪，只做有分寸的进退，绝无磅礴的力量，恰与人物的困惑、自我怀疑和否定共鸣。倘若读者自身也有同样困惑和怀疑的想法，便觉得这些句子是由自己内心生长出来一般，连语气和表情都可感知。

# Excerpt 9

* Introduction

Tucker Crowe, 55, was a American singer-songwriter who had been doing nothing for 20 years. In an escape from an awkard reunion with the four children from ex-wives he abandoned, he brought his 6-year old son Jakcson to Gooleness, a boring north England seaside town where they were hosted by Annie, who offered herself to Tucker out of a short but deep, personal affection that started from their emails. This scene is their second and last night, where Annie tried to express her feelings for Tucker，only to be interupted.

55岁的 Tucker Crowe 是一名来自美国，无所事事20年的前唱作人。为了躲避曾经被他抛弃的家人，Tucker带着6岁的小儿子 Jackson 来到 Gooleness，一座清寂的英格兰北部海滨小镇，借住在他新近的笔友，40岁的Annie家中。Annie 十分珍重 Tucker，借偶然的契机，终于鼓起勇气献身于他。第二晚，分别前夕，Annie 试着完整地表达自己对 Tucker 的感情，然而刚开始便结束。

我连自己写的前情都翻不好还想翻小说[捂脸]。有三处翻的不好：一处是关于家人，Tucker 逃离的是尴尬和惭愧，中文写没交代出来，怕是要理解成前妻上门要钱；affection 也很难，Annie 对 Tucker 是极真诚而强烈的感情，但又不是小女孩式的热恋；最后献身是什么鬼...Annie 鼓起勇气是真的，可献身未免显得太卑微，无论 Tucker 还是作者都无意使 Annie 卑微，但我想不出来一个平淡自然的字眼来描述性。

Excerpt

The following day, Jackson talked to his mother on the phone and became upset, and Tuckcer booked their flights home. On the last night, Tucker and Annie shared a bed, but they didn't have sex again.

'I'll come back,'said Tucker. 'I like it here.'

'Nobody comes back.'

Annie didn't know whether she meant the town or the bed, but either way there was some bitterness in there, and she didn't want that.

'Or you could come over.'

'I've used up a lot of my holidays.'

'There are other jobs.'

'I'm not taking lectures or alternative careers from you.'

第二天，Jackson 和妈妈通了一会儿电话，开始有些焦躁，Tucker订好了回美国的机票。最后一个夜晚，Tucker 和 Annie 睡在一张床上，但只是躺着。

我会再来的，Tucker 说，我挺喜欢这儿。

谁都不会再来。Annie 不知道自己这句话指的是回这座小镇，还是回这张床。但话里的苦涩意味却挥之不去，她不喜欢这样。

那你可以过去我那儿。

我把假期用光了。

可以换工作嘛。

我才不听你的。

'OK. So, I'm never coming back here, you're never going over there... It's difficult to find the place where we can at least pretend that there's some sort of future'

'Is that what you normally do after a one-night stand?'said Annie,'Pretend there's a future?' She couldn't seem to change the tone in her voice, no matter what she did. She didnt want to scoff and taunt; she wanted to find a way to hope, but she only seemed to beble to speak one language. Typical bloody British, she thought.

'I'm just going to ignore you,' said Tucker.

She put her arms around him.'I'll miss you. And Jackson.'

There. It wasn't much, and it was entirely unrepresentative of the grief and panic that were already probing for promising-looking ways of escape, but she hoped at least he heard uncomplicated affection.

呃，那好吧，我不会回来，你也不会过去...我们甚至都没法自欺，假装还会再见面。

你每次跟人过夜之后都这样么？自欺？ Annie 怎么也改不掉这尖刻的语调。她没有奚落的意思，她只想要有一点期待。


我不理你了。

Annie 伸手搂住 Tucker，我会想你的。还有Jackson。

这次好多了。轻飘飘的一句话，没有吐露出她心里快要溢出来的哀伤和惶，但至少她试着简单清白地告诉他，她爱他。

pretend    好难翻。要找一个能额外带宾语的自欺。

I'm just going to ignore you.  这句话带有一点宽容似的色彩。

panic     翻成惶惑，直接从歌词抄的，很不恰当。

probing for ways of escape.  这里的escape应该是指忍不住要说出来。翻得更含蓄一点，连暗示想要说都没有。

'You'll email, right? A lot?'

'Oh, I've got nothing to say.

'I'll tell you when i'm bored.'

'Oh, God, 'she said. 'Now i'll be scared to write anything.'

'JesusChrist, said Tucker.'You dont make it easy'

'No', said Annie. 'that's because it isnt. that's why mostly it goes wrong. that's why you've been divorced a thousand times. Because it isn t easy.'

She was trying to say something else; she was trying to say that the inability to articulate what one feels in any satistactory way is one of our enduring tragedies. It wouldnt have been much, and it wouldn't have been useful, but it would have been something that reflected the gravity and the sadness inside her. Instead, she had snapped at him for being a loser. It was as if she were trying to find a finghold on the boulder of her feelings, and had merely ended up with grits under her nails.

Tucker 道：你还会写邮件的对吧？经常写？

哎，我不知道该说些什么。

随便，我想听的时候会告诉你的。

哦天哪，你这么说我都不敢联系你了。

真是要命， Tucker 说，你把事情搞得这么复杂。

不，事情就是这么复杂，人与人之间就是这么复杂。所以关系才会破裂，所以你才会不停地离婚。因为复杂。

她都说了些什么啊。她想说，一个人不可能把自己的感情准确地表达给另一个人听，一旦开口注定要以双方的尴尬收场，这是人类永恒的悲剧。她本来应该这样述说自己的沉重，尽管这没什么意义，没什么用。可结果呢？话一出口，她只是责难 Tucker 不断搞砸。她心中有千钧磐石，伸手却只能抓下几颗沙砾。

The inability to articulate what one feels in any satistactory way is one of our enduring tragedies. Satisfactory,    我做了两种理解，一并呈现；

our enduring tragedies    our所指极广，但翻译成人类，有点妄自尊大。

Tucker sat up in bed and looked at her.

'You should make up with Duncan,' he said. 'He'd take you back. Especially now. you've got about nine years' worth of material for him.'

'What good would that do me?'

'None at all', said Tucker. 'That would be the point.'

She tried one last time.

'I'm sorry. I dont know what to say. I know that... that love is supposed to be transformative.' Now she'd used the word she felt her tongue loosen. 'And that's how I'm trying to look at it. There, Bang. I've been transformed, and however it happened it doesn't matter. You can go or stay, and it will still have happened. So i've been trying to look at you as a metaphor or something. But it doesn'twork. The terribly inconvenient fact is that, without you around everything slides back to how it was before. It can't do otherwise. And I have to say, books haven't helped much with all this. Because whenever you read anything about love, whenever anyone tries to define it, there's always a state or an abstract noun, and I try to think of it like that. But actually, love is... Well, it's just you. And when you go, it's gone. Nothing abstract about it.'

Tucker 坐起身子看着她。

你应该跟Duncan复合。他肯定愿意。尤其是眼下，够他痴迷好几年了。

[注：Duncan 是Annie的前任，同居十五年但没有结婚，更没有子女。Duncan 是全世界最狂热的 Tucker 粉丝，自Tucker 沉寂以后不断搜集消息，解读歌词。Annie 与 Tucker 相识亦由此开始。]

这对我有什么帮助？

什么帮助都没有，要的就是没有。

她最后一次试着开口。

我很抱歉，我不知道说什么好。我明白...爱应该是独立存在的。。这个字一出口，她的闸门仿佛打开了。我也试着这样看待它。Bang，一秒钟，我已经爱过了，至于过程并不重要。你尽可以离开，或者留下也好，但对我已经足够了。我想把你看作一个符号，一种仪式。可是这没用。一旦你离开了，一切就变回原来的样子，只能如此。那些书也帮不上忙。无论什么书都只能用感受，用抽象名词来描述爱。可其实爱是...爱就是你。没有你就没有爱，一点都不剩。

Not at all, that would be the point.  这句我没看懂 Tucker 的用意。

transformative    规避了直译。

'Dad.'

Annie was confused. but Tucker seemed to know who it was immediately. Jackson was standing by the bed, damp and malodorous'.

'what's up, son?'

'I just threw up in my bed'

'OK.'

'I think I don' t like Twiglets any more'

'You ve maybe been hitting them a little hard. We'll get you cleaned up. Have you got any spare sheets, Annie?'

爸爸。

Annie 有点懵，而 Tucker 立刻反应过来了。Jackson 站在床边，身上湿湿臭臭的。

怎么了儿子？

我吐在床上了。

嗯，没事。

我想我以后不爱吃辣条了。

可能你今天吃得太多了而已。来吧，我们去洗一下。Annie，有新床单么？

* 选段评论

这一段情节的结尾很棒。Annie 的告白还没得到回应，两人的对话便被 Jackson 打断，仿佛永远得不到回应了。被爱的人往往便是这样从生命里黯淡退潮，留下未抚平的缺憾。永别也许是最后一次下课铃声，是一份未及送达的礼物，是一串空号的提示音，是安检队伍攒动的人群，甚至是微信里十分钟便再也无法挽回的冷场。It just so happens and there's nobody to blame, 只有怜惜自己不幸。作者安排 Jackson 来打断对话。一个六岁的孩子吐了，而已。Annie 的不幸也就更甚。

Annie 说，love is not transformative, 爱与被爱的人一并存在。这点我倒不甚同意。我认定爱是记忆。可以被创作，也可以被保留。也许，只是不想承认，there's nothing left.

在大段地告白前，Annie 反复地言不及义，直到 The inability to articulate what one feels in any satistactory way is one of our enduring tragedies。我极喜欢这一句，翻译时也画蛇添足加了额外的解读。

Unsatisfactory，可以是指混乱的陈述，也可以是指听者和讲者共同经历的这煎熬的对话。当一个人被迫需要用语言把自己的心意解释给另一个人听时，便已经没有希望了。冷淡而礼貌的做法，是 pretend there's some sort of future, 心照不宣。

这一段已经是全书的尾声。作者最后安排了一个 Happy Ending，Annie 决心来到美国，Tucker 也终于 find inner peace，但这部分情节只有侧面呈现。对煎熬的情节用近景加强代入，而对幸福的生活只能道听途说，这恰恰符合每个人常有的心境，也是 Nick Hornby 小说的一大趣味。
